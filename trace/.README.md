# TRACE GENERATOR

Each folder contains a different asm program to convert to traces, with:
- code.md: Describes what the assembly code does, the assembly code and its manual conversion to readable memory instructions. Shows logic behind the program and conversion. `code_file_description.md` details its logic.
- template.md: Less readable version of the memory instruction. Used by `convert.py` to generate trace

`convert.py` is a simple program that accepts arguments: <file-origin>, <trace-destination> and creates the trace
Follows a simple sequential read logic where all loops are meant to sequentially run on some array.
The values for array size, and potentially some step logic on the array iteration are hardcoded, and need to be changed on the file
