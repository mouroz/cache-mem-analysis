# TRACE GENERATOR

A single assembly has been used to generate the trace in ./write_array.asm

The memory instructions were then interpreted from it. The logic can be seen at ./write_array_aux

The final template used for conversion can be seen at ./template.txt
The template is text sensitive and does not accept any descriptions

./convert.py is used to generate the the trace file from the template

./trace.txt is the generated trace
